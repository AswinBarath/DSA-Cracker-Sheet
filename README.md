## Array

### ✅ 1. Reverse the array

- Applied **two pointers approach** for swapping at both ends, shrinking the window for each traversal
- Applied **Iteration** and **Recursion** to reverse the array
- Applied **Control flow**: *for, while* for loops and *if, switch* for decision making

---

### ✅ 2. Maximum and minimum of an array

- Applied **Linear search** to find maximum and minimum in just one iteration
- Applied **Iteration** and **Recursion** to find maximum and minimum in the array
- Applied **Control flow**: *for* for loop and *if, switch* for decision making
